# EDA_using_Personal_Email_Dataset
## Exploratory Data Analysis on Personal Email Data
This project involved conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a personal email dataset to gain insights into email usage patterns.

## Data Preprocessing
The data was loaded into a pandas dataframe and various data cleaning and preprocessing tasks were performed, including dropping duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types.

## Data Visualization
Visualizations were created using various plots and charts to understand patterns and trends in email traffic, such as the total number of emails sent and received over time, the distribution of emails across different days, months, and years, and the length of emails.

## Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming were used to analyze email content. Word clouds were created to visualize the most frequent words used in the emails.

## Key Insights
The analysis revealed several key insights, such as the busiest days for email traffic being weekdays, with Friday being the busiest, and the number of emails sent and received increasing over the years, with the highest volume in 2018. The average email length was around 100-200 words, with a maximum length of over 2000 words, and the most frequent words used in the emails were related to work, such as "meeting", "project", and "deadline".

Overall, this EDA project on personal email data provided valuable insights into email usage patterns, which can help in better understanding communication habits.
